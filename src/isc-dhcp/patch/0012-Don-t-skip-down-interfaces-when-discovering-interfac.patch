Subject: [PATCH] Don't skip down interfaces when discovering interfaces in
 relay mode

When discovering interfaces in relay mode, don't skip interfaces just
because they're down. If we fail to discover the interfaces because they
are down when the relay starts, but then are brought up at a later point
in time, the relay will discard any packets received on them because it
didn't discover the interface(s) when it started up.
